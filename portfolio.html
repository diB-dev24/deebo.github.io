            <br>
                    <p>Murals done by Yona Mudibo are typically based on the requirements of the commissioning client. These murals have covered issues
                such as exploitation of children, plastic pollution, racial unity, health education or innovation.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Sculptures and installations are a perfect way to reuse plastics into works of art. Yona uses plastics to make inspired artworks
                    while advocating against plastic pollution. The plastics used are collected from beach cleanups, collected from used plastics, or donated from recycling companies.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>In paintings, Mudibo explores more into self identity. Painting provides a great avenue to express abstract themes such as; love,
                    hate, serenity, lust, among others</p>

                    <p>Through string art, Mudibo explores the themes of heritage by intricately interlacing a thread through a myriad of nails to create
                    mindblowing artworks.

                    <br>
                    <p>Body art is a widely practised craft in various cultures. It has been used to express identity, in rituals and rite, or mark a significant event.
                    For Mudibo, body art has been a journey into discovering the cultures of artful people. Such as the <strong>"Mapi"</strong> pattern of the coastal people of Kenya,
                    geometric patterns used to decorate huts in the Luhya community, and some Ankara symbols.
